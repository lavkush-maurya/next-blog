## Overview of Next.js 15 RC and React 19

With **Next.js 15 Release Candidate (RC)**, developers get an opportunity to test significant new features before the stable release, including **React 19** support, **improved caching defaults**, **Partial Prerendering (PPR)**, and the experimental **React Compiler**. These additions are aimed at making applications faster, more efficient, and easier to manage. Let's dive into each feature and explore how they can impact modern web development.

## Key Features in Next.js 15 RC

### 1. React 19 RC Support

The Next.js App Router is now compatible with **React 19 RC**, which brings exciting new APIs and features for both client and server environments. One standout feature is **Actions**, a new API designed to simplify client-server interactions, making it easier to handle server actions directly within components.

> **Note**: Some third-party libraries may not yet be compatible with React 19, so check library compatibility before migrating fully.

### 2. Experimental React Compiler

The new **React Compiler** is an experimental tool that optimizes performance by minimizing the need for `useMemo` and `useCallback`, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making the code easier to maintain.

To try it out, install the `babel-plugin-react-compiler` and enable the experimental feature in `next.config.js`:

```js
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    reactCompiler: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

Or set the compiler in opt-in mode:

```js
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    reactCompiler: {
      compilationMode: 'annotation',
    },
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### 3. Caching Changes and Performance Optimizations

Caching updates in Next.js 15 RC simplify data handling by making `fetch` requests and **GET Route Handlers** uncached by default. This means data is fetched fresh with every request, enhancing dynamic behavior. However, caching can still be configured when needed:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com', { cache: 'force-cache' })
```

#### Client Router Cache Adjustments

In Next.js 15, **Client Router Cache** no longer caches Page components by default. This ensures the latest data is displayed without needing manual configuration.

### 4. Partial Prerendering (PPR)

**Partial Prerendering (PPR)** enables a mix of static and dynamic rendering within a single page. This powerful feature, now available for incremental adoption, allows developers to wrap dynamic components within `Suspense`, optimizing initial load time by streaming dynamic elements.

```jsx
// app/page.js
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import StaticComponent from '@/app/static'
import DynamicComponent from '@/app/dynamic'

export const experimental_ppr = true

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <StaticComponent />
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <DynamicComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Experimental `next/after` API for Post-Response Tasks

With the `next/after` API, you can defer tasks like logging or analytics until after a response has finished, optimizing response time. This is especially useful for background tasks that don’t need to block the user experience.

```js
import { unstable_after as after } from 'next/server'

after(() => {
  console.log('Executing post-response task.')
})
```

## Final Thoughts on Next.js 15 RC

The features introduced in **Next.js 15 RC** reflect the framework’s commitment to performance and usability. While the RC version may include breaking changes, experimenting with these features now can help teams prepare for the future and fine-tune application performance before the stable release.
