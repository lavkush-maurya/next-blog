Hey, welcome back <Twemoji emoji="waving-hand" />

Today I will share with you a simple way to embed a script into a webpage using **Github** and **jsDelivr**

## Problem

You want to add a feature to a webpage without having to modify the existing scripts on the page because it's too complicated to configure, change, and remove.
You only need this feature for a certain period of time.

If you have the same need, then here is a simple solution that I think you should do.

## Solution

- Host your `script` on **Github** (which can also include `style`).

Simply create a **public repository** on Github, `push` your script and style there.
(Remember to make it **public** so that it can be embedded.)

- Use [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) as a CDN for your script.

**jsDelivr** is a simple tool used as a **CDN** for any **npm** package, **Github** repo or **WordPress** plugin.

The usage instructions are available on the homepage of **jsDelivr**. Here's how to use it with a **Github** repo:

```js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{user}/{repo}/{directory}/{file}
```

This is the structure of a script/style URL hosted through **jsDelivr** for any file on **Github**:

- `{user}`: your **username** or **organization** on **Github**
- `{repo}`: **repository** name
- `{directory}`: **folder** name (optional) because your file can be placed in the root directory of the **repo**
- `{file}`: filename, `*.js` or `*.css`

For example:

This is one of my public repos: [Minimog badges](https://github.com/Insights-Labs/minimog-badges).
I hosted 2 files on it, 1 **Javascript** file and 1 **CSS** file.

![minimog-badges-repo](/static/images/minimog-badges-repo.jpg)

So the URL hosted through **jsDelivr** for these 2 files will be:

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Insights-Labs/minimog-menu-badges/style-v1.css`

and:

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Insights-Labs/minimog-badges/main-v3.js`

Now simply **embed** them into your page with the `link` tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Insights-Labs/minimog-menu-badges/style-v1.css">
```

and the `script` tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Insights-Labs/minimog-badges/main-v3.js" async></script>
```

Now the 2 files hosted on **Github** are running on your page. <Twemoji emoji="party-popper" />

## Tips

- Caching

If you notice, I put the version number in the filename `main-v3.js` and `style-v1.css`. Why do you need to add this **version** number?

The answer is because **jsDelivr** caches your resource.
This is good for faster resource loading, but when you make changes, the cache is not cleared immediately, resulting in the old code still being loaded.

To purge the cache, you need to email **jsDelivr**, which is quite inconvenient.
So my simple solution is to put the version number right in the filename.
When you make changes, create a new file with a name containing the new version number. For example: `main-v4.js` or `style-v2.css`,
and modify the embed link, and you will have the new code immediately without waiting for the cache to clear.

- Minify

If your code is not minified, simply add `.min` to the URL of the file, and **jsDelivr** will generate a minified version for your original file.

For example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Insights-Labs/minimog-badges/main-v3.min.js" async></script>
```

## Conclusion

I hope this tutorial can be helpful to you!
