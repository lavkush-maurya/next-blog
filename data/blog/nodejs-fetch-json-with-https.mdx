When working with Node.js, there are many libraries that support creating requests to another server, such as `node-fetch`, `phin`, `got` or `request` (deprecated)...

However, if your **server** simply serves as an API for a client app and you now need to `request` a `JSON` file from another server or simply fetch an external API, which library should you choose to use? <Twemoji emoji="thinking-face" />

The answer is that you don't need to add a new dependency to your `package.json` just for creating a request because Node.js has a built-in module called `https`.

## HTTPS

`https` is a lightweight module that comes pre-built in Node.js and is supported in most Node.js versions.

You can create a `request` using `https` as follows:

```js {8,11} showLineNumbers
let https = require('https')

https
  .get(url, (res) => {
    let body = ''
    res.on('data', (chunk) => (body += chunk))
    res.on('end', () => {
      try {
        let json = JSON.parse(body)
        // Now you can use json data...
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(`Failed to parse JSON data - ${err.toString()}`)
      }
    })
  })
  .on('error', (err) => {
    console.error(`Failed to make request! Error: ${err.toString()}`)
  })
```

In the code above:

- **https** is a built-in module in Node.js so you can `require` it directly without the need for installation.
- You can create a **request** using `https.get(url[, options][, callback])`.
- In the **callback**, you listen to the response events using `res.on()`.
- Each time `res.on("data")` is triggered, you add the `data` to the string `body`.
- When `res.on("end")` is triggered, you can simply parse the body into a JSON object using `JSON.parse(body)`.
- Lines `8` and `11`: Note that you should parse the data within a `try {} catch() {}` block to catch errors if the JSON cannot be parsed.
- If the **request** fails, the `error` event will be triggered.

That's it! Now let's abstract this logic into a function that can be used anywhere in the `server`:

```javascript
let https = require('https')

let fetchJSON = (url) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    https
      .get(url, (res) => {
        let body = ''
        res.on('data', (chunk) => (body += chunk))
        res.on('end', () => {
          try {
            resolve(JSON.parse(body))
          } catch (err) {
            reject(err)
          }
        })
      })
      .on('error', reject)
  })
}

module.exports = fetchJSON
```

And you can use it as follows:

```js
// Async context
let data = await fetchJSON(url)

// Use the data...
```

Good luck! <Twemoji emoji="party popper" />
