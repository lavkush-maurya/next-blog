## Reusable JSX Code Snippets

These snippets provide common solutions and patterns used in JSX and React development. From conditional rendering to dynamic styling, these patterns are highly reusable and will simplify many of your UI tasks.

### 1. Conditional Component Rendering

This pattern is useful when you need to render different components based on a condition.

```js
function ConditionalComponent({ condition }) {
  return condition ? <ComponentA /> : <ComponentB />;
}
```

- **Use Case**: Toggle between components based on a boolean condition, such as displaying a loader or the actual content once data has loaded.

### 2. Map Over an Array to Render a List of Components

Rendering lists is common in React applications. The `map()` function allows you to iterate over an array and display a list of components.

```js
function ListComponent({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

- **Use Case**: Perfect for rendering dynamic content like product listings, blog posts, or any other data-driven list.

### 3. Render a Component with Inline Styles

Sometimes you may want to add styles directly within your JSX code, using the `style` attribute.

```js
function InlineStyleComponent() {
  const styles = {
    color: 'red',
    fontSize: '16px',
  };

  return <div style={styles}>Hello, World!</div>;
}
```

- **Use Case**: Ideal for quick styling solutions or dynamic styling based on JavaScript logic.

### 4. Conditional Styling Based on Props

This snippet helps you apply different styles depending on a prop, like changing color based on an `isActive` state.

```js
function ConditionalStyleComponent({ isActive }) {
  const styles = {
    color: isActive ? 'blue' : 'gray',
    fontSize: '16px',
  };

  return <div style={styles}>Hello, World!</div>;
}
```

- **Use Case**: Useful for toggling visual states (e.g., a button or link changing color based on whether itâ€™s active).

### 5. Stateful Component with Event Handler

This snippet shows how to use the `useState` hook to manage component state and handle user interactions like click events.

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

function StatefulComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Use Case**: Commonly used for interactive components like counters, forms, or any component that needs state management.

### 6. Dynamic Class Names Based on Props

This is helpful when you need to apply different class names to a component based on its state or props.

```js
function DynamicClassComponent({ isActive }) {
  const classNames = `component ${isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive'}`;

  return <div className={classNames}>Hello, World!</div>;
}
```

- **Use Case**: Useful for toggling CSS classes in response to state changes, like toggling a sidebar open or closed.
