## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I started this blog as a way to document and share the things I have learned and found useful in my journey as a software engineer.

Writing and noting things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies,
and I hope that my blog can be a helpful resource for others who are interested in web development, eCommerce, and related technologies.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.

## Tech stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the minimal, lightweight, and super easy-to-customize blog starter.

A few major over-engineering-changes from the original repo:

- <Twemoji emoji="atom-symbol" /> Upgrading to **React 18**, **Next 13**
- <Twemoji emoji="party-popper" /> Adopting **Typescript**, committing with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- <Twemoji emoji="eyes" /> Theming in dark mode with [Github dark dimmed](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-14-dark-and-dimmed-themes-are-now-generally-available/)
  colors for better contrast
- <Twemoji emoji="man-technologist" /> Making a lot of changes to the UI, new homepage design, adding
  `ProfileCard`, `CareerTimeline` components, adding `/snippets`, `/resume` page, etc.
- <Twemoji emoji="inbox-tray" /> Bumping up `mdx-bundler`, `rehype`/`remark` plugins and dependencies
  to the latest version

See my [repository](https://github.com/lavkush-maurya/next-blog) for this blog.

The legacy version built with **Gatsby** can be found [here](https://lavkushgatsby.netlify.app/).
